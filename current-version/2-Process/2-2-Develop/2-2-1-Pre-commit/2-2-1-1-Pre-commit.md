# Pre-Commit

> Prevention is better than cure
> It is better to stop something bad from happening than it is to deal with it after it has happened.

The phrase is attributed to [Benjamin Franklin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin), who famously advised the citizens of Philadelphia in the 18th century that "an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure," relating it to preventing fires.

The `pre-commit` phase is important because it can prevent security issues before they are ever recoded as part of the git history.

## Git hooks

Git hooks are scripts that are self-executed before or after events like committing, pushing, or receiving. They are categorized into client-side and server-side hooks.

### Server-Side Hooks

Server-side hooks resides in server-side repositories (e.g., a central repository, or a developer‚Äôs public repository). When attached to the official repository, some of these can serve as a way to enforce policy by rejecting certain commits.

You should also keep in mind that server-side hooks can become very ressources intensive and cause significant security impact.  For these reasons, server-side hooks are rarely use and often prohibited by some vendor.  Yet these exists and the best exemple for such capability is most likely [GitHub: Push Protection](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/secret-scanning/introduction/about-push-protection), a pre-Receive hooks used as part of GitHub secret scanning feature.

- post-receive: Executed after a successful push, after all refs have been updated. Used for notifications, triggering CI/CD pipelines, etc.
- post-update: Similar to post-receive, but invoked with a list of updated refs.
- pre-receive: Executed when a push is received by the server, before any refs are updated. Used for enforcing policies.
- reference-transaction: Executed during a reference transaction, allowing validation or actions related to ref updates.
- update: Executed once per ref being updated during a push. Allows fine-grained control over which refs are accepted.

### Client-Side Hooks

Client-side hooks are custom scripts that are triggered on a developer's local machine during the Git workflow lifecycle.

They can be found within the `.git/hooks` directory of a local repository and are not automatically copied when cloning a repository.  By default, Git provides examples of how you can use a varities of hooks. Theses exemples are suffix as  `.sample` preventing them from being run.  Removing the suffix will trigger the associated hook automatically during such Git event occurences.

Git hooks script can access large available system wide languages and tool although these are found low level programming langauge such as `bash`, `python`, `perl` and so on.  Given these hooks are not included as part of the repository, `native git hooks` can be cumbersome to share and maintain at scale within an organization.  Each developer needs to set up these hooks individually for each repository or using advance git configuration making these unuseful to manage them across a team.

Several open-source [tool](#tools1) are attempting to simplify such managemnt and distribution.

- applypatch-msg: Invoked by git am to process the commit message of a patch.
- commit-msg: Executed after the user has entered a commit message. Used for validating the message format.
- post-applypatch: Invoked by git am after applying a patch.
- post-checkout: Executed after a git checkout or git switch command has updated the working tree.
- post-commit: Executed after a commit is successfully created.
- post-index-change: Executed after the index is changed by commands like git update-index or git add.
- post-merge: Executed after a successful git merge command.
- post-rewrite: Executed after commands that rewrite history (e.g., git commit --amend, git rebase).
- pre-applypatch: Invoked by git am before applying a patch.
- pre-auto-gc: Executed before Git automatically runs garbage collection.
- pre-commit: Executed before a commit is created. Used for validating code style, running tests, etc.
- pre-merge-commit: Similar to pre-commit, but specifically for merge commits.
- pre-push: Executed before git push attempts to update remote refs.
- pre-rebase: Executed before a rebase operation begins.
- prepare-commit-msg: Executed after the default commit message is created, but before the editor is launched. Allows modification of the message.
- push-to-checkout: Executed on the client side when a git push is performed and the remote repository is configured for push-to-checkout.
- sendemail-validate: Used by git send-email to validate email messages.

## Usages

DevSecOps objectives are to shift-left security and checks earlier in the process therefore increasing quality, reducing risk and improving time to resolution.  Although, we have to recognized that adding these requirement increase an already heavy mental load for the developpers whom are already joggling with several complexe topics.  Therefore automation and simplicity of usage is key.

<!-- **Pre-commit** is a git feature that can be leveraged as part of the **shift-left security** approach where the developers are empowered to view the issues in the source code earlier in the SDLC process.  When the developer runs a git-commit command to commit the code into their local repository, **pre-commit hook** check can be integrated with a security scanning tool executed to look for code quality issues, hard-coded secrets, insecure code, vulnerable dependencies/opensource libraries, etc..

It is to be noted that pre-commit hooks are at the developer's local repository level and not the remote repository commonly used by all the developers working on the same project/application. In such cases when it's required to prevent security issues before they are submitted to a remote/central (Git) repository **pre-push hook** or **git-push** checks can be configured. Refer: <https://git-scm.com/docs/git-push>

Another alternative approach to scan the source code for security issues (such as hardcoded-secrets, insecure code and vulnerable dependencies/opensource libraries) is the use of **SAST/SCA IDE plugins**. This works together with the IDEs used by developers while they write the code. Whereas, git-commit and git-push actions are used after the code is written by the developer. It is necessary to discern these distinct use-cases in order to implement the proper security controls at various levels based on the requirement.

The following image can give you a better view of what the pre-commit means and why we must consider it.

Regardless of how many checks you want to run, there can only be one `.git/hooks/pre-commit` executable per repository, which can be a bit cumbersome, especially when you have multiple checks. Several [tools](#tools1) have been creating to increase performance and ease of usage solving this chllenges. -->

### Pre-Commit Hooks

One of the most useful hooks is the **pre-commit**, which, as the name implies, is run right before the commit actually happens.  Given this script are run automatically during the normal workflow used by the developper when a new change is commited to the codebase.  Therefore automatically running checks on the proposed code changes and verifying if it violate potentially quality or security at the last possible minute, after which reject the changes guiding the developper toward early resolutions.

- Finding potential security risks
- Catching formatting issues
- Validating configurations
- Running quick tests
- Enforcing team standards

### Commit-Msg Hooks

Another fairly common and useful hooks is the **commit-msg**, which, as the name implies, is run right before the commit message actually happens.  Structuring a project Git commit messages can help amongst developpers to understand changes impact and Git history readability.  Internal project management tools might also leverage Git commit messages to track development items progress over time using keyword.

Furthermore, various specification that standardizes the structure of Git commit messages exist, making them both human and machine-readable exist. This type of standardization enables the creation of an explicit commit history, which facilitates automated tools for tasks like changelog generation and semantic versioning.

- Enforcing team standards

## Considerations

### Annoyances

Pre-commit should be kept as an elective toolchain for the developpers to opt-in or kept to be extemely minimalistic.  Pre-commit hooks are capturing issues and problems early but by definition are slowing down the developper natural workflow which can be annoying for some.  This constant capture of new issues can create a significant impact on the developper continuously context switch between completing the task at hand and addressing security or code quality requirement.

```bash
alias gwip='git add -A; git rm $(git ls-files --deleted) 2> /dev/null; git commit --no-verify --no-gpg-sign --message "--wip-- [skip ci]"'
```

### CI Pipeline

CI pipeline should follow the [Verification and validation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verification_and_validation) quality assurance processes therefore all require checks rans via the `pre-commit hooks` should be ran in some shape or form during the integration phase.  Typically, some actions rans as `gi

of the more advanced tool like secret scanner, sast, sca and others will have dedicated pre-configuration jobs|workflows

Pre-commit should be kept as an elec
